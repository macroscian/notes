* R Snippets
Helper functions for operating on scripts interactively.  None of
these functions should be used in saved scripts or packages. They're
primarily for debugging (other people's) code.

** Change file-path to a writeable area in scratch
#+begin_src r
writeable <- function(here, writeable="/camp/stp/babs/scratch/kellyg/write-area") {
  here_comps <- strsplit(here(here), split=.Platform$file.sep, fixed=TRUE)[[1]]
  write_comps<- strsplit(writeable, split=.Platform$file.sep, fixed=TRUE)[[1]]
  mlen <- min(length(here_comps), length(write_comps))
  first_diff <- which(here_comps[1:mlen]!=write_comps[1:mlen])[1]
  if (is.na(first_diff)) {
    here
  } else {
    do.call(file.path, as.list(c(write_comps[1:first_diff], paste(here_comps[-(1:first_diff)], collapse="-"))))
  }
}
